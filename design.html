                        <h4>Ideas</h4>

                        <p>
                            Every program starts with an idea. Make sure you are working with a topic that you know well and is of interest to you.
                            Once you have chosen the main idea, research the domain it falls in:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Painting Application</li>
                            <li>Generative Art Application</li>
                            <li>Interactive Slideshow</li>
                            <li>Data Visualization</li>
                            <li>Videogame
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Puzzle Game</li>
                                    <li>Arcade Game</li>
                                    <li>Action Game</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            Why does your application fit into this domain? What makes your application similar to existing applications
                            in this domain, and what makes it different?
                        </p>

                        <h4>Requirements</h4>
                        <p>
                            What does your application need to do? Before programming you should make a detailed list of everything that will be included
                            in your application.
                        </p>

                            Example for painting application:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Welcome / start screen</li>
                            <li>3 brush tool buttons</li>
                            <li>1 clear screen button</li>
                            <li>1 save button</li>
                            <li>3 brush tools
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1 regular brush</li>
                                    <li>1 splatter brush</li>
                                    <li>1 geometric brush</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Scope</h4>
                        <p>
                            Put a time estimate next to your list of requirements. How long will each take? Give yourself lots of room for error.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Is it too much time? Maybe you can cut some requirements? Maybe the idea is beyond your skill level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whatever it is, make sure you have scoped your design to something manageable before you start working.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Universal Modeling Language</h4>

                        <p>
                            Disclaimer: this is not the correct way to write UML. There are in fact many ways to do UML diagrams, and we will
                            only be looking at those features that are important to this course and multimedia programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you'd like to learn more, take a look. This lecture should provide you with the basics.

                        <p class="left">
                            A UML diagram for a class begins with the class name at the top. Clearly we are going to define a
                            Moving Object class, followed by two sub-classes: Player and Enemy.

                        <h4>Adding Fields</h4>

                        <img class="left" src="img/uml/umlFields.png" />


                        <p class="left">
                            Now we've added some fields to the classes, and notice this takes on the same structure as if we were to
                            actually code the class. Define the class name, list the fields, list the methods.

                        <p class="left">
                            When adding methods it is important to encapsulate the method signature and the return type. This should give you a clear idea
                            of what the method will be doing based on: name and parameters (signature) and the return type.

                        <p class="left">
                            We're only concerned with showing our inheritance relationship in our UML diagrams. This is displayed by drawing a solid
                            white arrow from the subclass pointing to the superclass.

                        <img class="left" src="img/uml/patterns.jpg" />


                        <p class="left">
                            There are several ways to organize objects into a functioning application. Design patters are a way to
                            approach the problem of complexity. Mainly, we cannot have all objects contained in ArrayLists declared in the
                            main program, at some point we'd like those objects to simply take care of themselves.
                            We're going to look at two useful software design patterns that organize complexity in an application.

                        <p class="left">
                            In the decorator pattern there is a main object that needs to be decorated, <strong>Component</strong>. The <strong>Component</strong>
                            contains a list of objects of type <strong>Decorator</strong>. The <strong>Concrete</strong> objects here are simply subclasses of the
                            two main classes we're talking about <strong>Components</strong> and <strong>Decorators</strong>.

                        <p>
                            A Player class has an ArrayList of type Reward. As the instance of Player scores points, instances of Reward are created and
                            added to the player's ArrayList. The player instance is now "decorated" with objects of type Reward.

                        <h4>Factory Pattern</h4>

                        <img class="left" src="img/uml/factory.svg" width="700" height="400" />


                        <p class="left">
                            In the factory pattern there are objects that need to be created with different properties and returned to some object
                            that contains them. A <strong>Creator</strong> has a factory method to create a <strong>Product</strong> which can be though of as
                            simply any object that needs creating. Subclasses of the <strong>Creator</strong> can override the factory method to return products of
                            different types.

                        <p>
                            A painting application may have several different instances of a BrushMovement and several different instances of BrushTips.
                            A factory method in the main Brush class can be used to return a single Brush object that combines a BrushMovement
                            with a BrushTip and returns the composite object to the main sketch where it can be added to an ArrayList.

                            Notice with the UML diagram that if it were complete we would have everything we needed to know in order
                            to create this game. We would know what classes, fields, methods and everything else to implement.
                            It's highly recommended to always create a detailed UML diagram for any application that goes beyond 2 or 3
                            classes or has more than a few simple functions.
                        </p>
